  "description": "Due to the recent crypto dip millions of crypto bros have lost their second comma. Have you heard? McDonalds is hiring! And crypto bro's are getting hired in super sized numbers!\n\nAfter the Mcdonald's hiring rush only a few spots remained to capture the coveted McDonalds name tag. We provide the only way to obtain these precious plastics without needing to work the front lines yourself. Purchase one of the first 22 NFT and the Livin' the Meme team will ship you the actual physical name tag itself!\n\nIf you've already served a tour of duty behind the fry lines, you can register your plastic badge of honor at our website for free.\n\nAnd remember **10% of all proceeds go to Ronald McDonald House Charity**. Don't be a selfish a-hole bro. Think of the kids! Squad up!",
